# bsg-sql-challenge
This repository contains my submission to the sql challenges on the backend study group.

## Guidelines
Ahead of the SQL challenge starting tomorrow, here are the rules guiding the challenge:


1. Submissions should be made on the day of that particular challenge..

2. Bonus tips are not necessary!  However, solving them would attract a ‚≠ê.

3. Your query should work on every SQL flavour. i.e plpgSQL is not allowed.

4. Plagiarism attracts disqualification. Resist the urge to copy someone else's submission.

To setup your database tables, here's the SQL file you'll need for the first few days. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OKilk29VERqMzw1e8NAgp7uKgaINybtS/view?usp=sharing
